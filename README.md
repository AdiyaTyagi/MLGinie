![Project Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/728bbd09-19aa-4721-b925-0ecd047c57d5)

---

## 📋**Objectives of the Project:** 

MLGenie is an AI-powered machine learning pipeline that allows users to upload their dataset, automatically train and compare multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), tune hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV, and visualize results via different plots and graphs, and also suggests the best model for the given dataset.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- ✅ Drag & drop CSV file
- ⚡ Trains Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost
- 🧪 Applies hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
- 📊 Shows Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- 🔍 Displays confusion matrix heatmaps
- 🧠 Recommends the best model for your dataset based on F1-Score

## 🎯 Model Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

## **Why This Dashboard Stands Out 🌟**

**1) User-Centric Design:** Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface for seamless user experience.

**2) Optimized Performance:** Efficient data Preprocessing and Train models for the given data.

**3) Scalability:** Designed to automate the Model training step for pipeline creation.

## 🚀 How to Run the App Locally

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlgenie.git
cd mlgenie
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Dash app:

```bash
python app/dashboard.py
```
